# Youtube-SHOUTOUT-WALL

A simple to use Shoutout Wall for Youtube.

> It's a simple shoutout wall which is with a back end (server) so you need to host it separatly from your front end scripts.
> All scripts in "server" folder with config.js need to be hosted on glitch or other node app hoster.

Don't forget to create a youtube api token on: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library

The other part so: "website scripts" folder with index.html must be hosted on a webhoster like 000webhost.

Also if you want to run it from your pc you need to install modules so need to have node.js and run `npm install` in server folder.

Hope you'll enjoy !
